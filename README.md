# 🧠 PathLine-ChartwellPartners (Clone & Feature Enhancement)

This project is a **cloned and enhanced version** of the real [Chartwell Partners](https://chartwellpartners.com/) website. The goal of this task was to **rebuild the original layout**, maintain its visual identity, and **add new interactive and responsive features** as part of my internship at **Pathline**.
