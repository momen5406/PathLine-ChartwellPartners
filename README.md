# 🧠 PathLine-ChartwellPartners (Clone & Feature Extension)

The project was a **cloned and enhanced version** of the real [Chartwell Partners](https://chartwellpartners.com/) website. The assignment in this project was to **replicate the original framework**, maintain its visual look, and **add new interactive and responsive features** as part of the **Pathline Internship Program**.

## 📌 Task Goal

This was a frontend development assignment for the **Pathline Internship Program**, where I needed to:
- Reconstruct a modern professional website layout.
- Follow modern web standards (HTML, CSS, JS).
- Add useful and new features.
- Adhere to clean and scalable code architecture.

## 🚀 Features Added

In addition to duplicating the initial site structure and appearance, I added:

1. **💡 Light / Dark Mode Toggle**
   - Clean theme switch with CSS variables and JavaScript.

2. **📱 Responsive Hamburger Menu**
   - Responsive navbar with dropdown effect.

3. **🔝 Scroll-to-Top Button**
   - Displays on scroll and returns user to the top with smooth animation.

4. **⏳ Animated Loading Overlay**
   - Subtle loading animation when the website is first loaded.

5. **📶 Scroll Progress Indicator**
   -  A dynamic progress bar at the top of the site showing how much of the page is scrolled.
